# Hotel Vanier

## Description

Our application, "Hotel Vanier," developed using C#, is designed as a GUI-based system to support and streamline employee tasks in managing customer information and reservations. The application includes a billing system tailored to individual client preferences. Employees can efficiently handle reservations by inputting client information into the database, making edits based on client choices such as the number of stays and room preferences. Billing details are also managed within the system to charge clients upon checkout. The goal is to empower employees to seamlessly add, edit, or remove clients from the database, enabling them to create reservations and generate bills based on client preferences.
